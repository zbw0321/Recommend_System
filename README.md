Topic 3.4: Recommender system using collaborative filtering 
=====
Introduction
-----
The recommendation system has widely employed in online service. It provides the guidance for users and helps them make choices. Although people have the different selection, they tend to choose similar things that they liked and choices by who has the homogeneous preference. The recommendation system can collect the similar features and helps to predict potentially favourite items for customers. 

Goals
-----
The goals of this assignment are:  
1. to make the prediction of movie rating for the users by implementing collaborative filtering algorithm.   
2. to use the most similar k users to predict ratings in improved user-based CF.
3. to evaluate the terms of accuracy according to Root-Mean-Square Error.
4. to find the optimize method with lower RMSE compared with Normalized Rating Method and SVD.

Dataset
-----
In this project, we use datasets ‘u.data’ (MoiveLens 100K Dataset) and ‘ratings.dat’ (MoiveLens 1M Dataset). 
Please download files and unzip them 
from the links http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/ and http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/

Run program
-----
Please put the two dataset files and the program ass2.py into same folder, and run it in Python3 
It will run the program with 100k dataset immediately, and ask you whether continue it cause the 1M dataset will take longer time.
